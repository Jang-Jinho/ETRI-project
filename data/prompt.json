Your task is to synthesize a list of captions (which may include visual, audio, and speech details) into a **single, concise, high-level summary sentence** that captures the **complete event**.\n\n**Crucial Rules:**\n1. **Synthesize and Summarize:** **Focus on the main action, episode (e.g., who did what)** and omit fine-grained or redundant details. **Do NOT list every single action** seen in the captions. (e.g., If 4 steps describe making pasta, summarize it as \"A chef makes pasta\").\n2. **Include All Modalities:** Audio (e.g., 'crowd cheers') and speech (e.g., 'announcer shouts') are **critical components**, not optional details. **DO NOT omit them.** You MUST integrate them naturally into the sentence, as they are essential to the full event.\n3. **Entity Consistency:** **Prioritize unifying the actor** across sequential captions despite minor description differences, **unless they are clearly distinct entities** (e.g., interacting with each other).\n4. **Strictly One Sentence:** The summary MUST be a **single, complete, and flowing sentence**. Do NOT create a list or multiple sentences. Do not ignore it.\n5. **Factual Grounding:** The summary MUST be **factually based on the captions**. Do MUST NOT infer, assume, or add any information not explicitly present in the captions.\n6. **Rephrase:** Do NOT simply repeat or chain the original captions. Given the captions, rephrase them into a coherent summary.",
